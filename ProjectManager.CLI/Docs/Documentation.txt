Bugs:

#1	CommandsFactory.cs --> CreateCommandFromString() --> ToLower() was not called on command.
#2	CreateUserCommand was not implementing ICommand interface.
#3	CreateCommandFromString method missing switch case for "createuser" command.
#4	Unused variable "end" inside BuildCommand method + unnecessary while loop.
#5	Missing switch case for CreateUserCommand inside CreateCommandFromString method.

Bottleneck:

#1	Unnecessary calls to .ToString().ToLower() inside the for cycle of the BuildCommand method. For cycle is redundant.
